# Subscription Renewal App

This project is part of my learning journey in C# programming. It aims to improve the renewal rate of subscriptions for a software system by displaying a renewal message to users when their subscription is about to expire.

## About

This project is a part of a course on improving coding skills in C#. It's a simple console application that demonstrates the use of decision statements to implement branching logic based on business rules.

## Learning Goals

- Apply decision statements (if-else) to implement branching logic.
- Utilize variables to store and manipulate data.
- Gain experience in writing clean and readable code.

## How to Run

To run this project, make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.

```
4. After a few momemnts, you should see the renewal message based on the current subscription status.

## Certification Path

This project contributes to my preparation for the C# certification exam. By completing exercises like this one, I am reinforcing my understanding of fundamental concepts and building practical coding skills required for the certification.
