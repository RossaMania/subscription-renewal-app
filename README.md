# Subscription Renewal App

This console application is designed to enhance the subscription renewal process for a software system by notifying users when their subscription is nearing expiration and offering discounts for renewal.

Now it's updated with switch cases instead of if-else-if statements!

## About

This project serves as a practical exercise in C# programming, focusing on decision-making structures to implement business logic. It simulates a scenario where users are alerted about their expiring subscriptions and incentivized to renew them promptly.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement decision statements (switch-case) to manage program flow based on subscription status.
- Utilize random number generation to simulate varying expiration durations.
- Enhance code readability and maintainability through structured programming.

## How to Run

To execute this project, ensure that the .NET SDK is installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
